            Muscle memory is a determining factor in many activities that we perform (more or less) daily. There are many times when we find ourselves performing certain actions in an extremely fluid way and without a real thought behind it. 

          </p>
          <p class="description2">
            Sometimes, however, phenomena of muscular memory can manifest themselves in environments that are not completely harmless and in which such movements constitute a condition of caging and of impossibility to leave certain schemes. One of the first examples that can come to mind are slot machines and betting sites, whose users, thanks to a particularly structured construction of the site, do not even realize the movements they make, especially over a very long period of time. This phenomenon is repeated with almost identical dynamics in the world of social: just like slot machines, but in a more subtle way, social networks have a series of inputs and a site construction that "hooks" the user in a repetitive series of actions. Scrolling, like a photo or surfing the feed are actions that now require a simple muscle memory, more than a real mental effort or a thought behind.

            <strong><em>AddictedBook</em></strong> is a browser app that makes the experience of Facebook in its basic features (notifications, messages, requests for friendship) almost impossible and sometimes unpleasant. In the design phase, four average actions were considered and all include a simple and banal removal of notifications and little else. Thanks to the app a visit that would normally take 2 to 5 minutes and that would involve a simple muscle memory is expanded, requiring an effort also and especially mental to complete most of the actions
